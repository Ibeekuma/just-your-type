I chose the concept because I wanted to illustrate the beauty of handwriting text.
For the paraghapy I use Quintessential to make the paraghapy stand out. For the header, I use Righteous To make it stand out.
I chose this type scale to make the header change as we adjust the screens.
I chose the color #d9ccaa because it contains mostly Yellow color, is a warm color.
I added the grid to the main tag and then add the class unit to the div tag inside the grid. Copied all code generated by Modulifier & paste it into my modules.css file.
The challenges was adding the grid or figuring the tag to add the grid class in with out messing up the html elements.
